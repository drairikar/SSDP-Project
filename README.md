# SSDP Project: Track-Before-Detect with Particle Filter for PSF Classification and Tracking.
This repository contains MATLAB code for performing **Track-Before-Detect (TBD)** using a **Particle Filter**, jointly estimating the target's trajectory and classifying its corresponding **Point-Spread Function (PSF)**.
